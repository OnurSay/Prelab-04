Java Beginner Lesson 3

In this question, we are simply created battleships game. We get the radar cooardinates in between 2 boundries. After that we created a new ship in between two coordinates boundries. The distance is calculated by using Math.sqrt function. And after that we using Math.floor to get the x coordinate. Same for y coordinate. We learned if else statements and how to crate a conditional program. x and y coordinates try to find the ship that we already created.
